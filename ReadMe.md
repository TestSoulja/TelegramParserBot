## TelegramParserBot
---
An outline of the bot code that:
1. takes posts from telegram channels
2. Paraphrases them through ChatGPT
3. Posts to a separate channel

This bot was originally conceived as a small project to monetize the Telegram channel. With a competent traffic of users to the channel we can eventually get a channel with constant up-to-date content on topics of interest to us, with good monetization through advertising.

For more competent work it is also necessary to moderate the content, as the neural network is not yet able to work with volumes of data without errors.
